                <font size= 15; font face= 'Times New Roman'>M</font>any cite that the origin of drones dates back to 1849, when <a href="http://www.ctie.monash.edu/hargrave/rpav_home.html#Beginnings">Austrian forces besieging Venice</a> attempted to float some 200 incendiary balloons 
                each carrying a 24- to 30-pound bomb that was to be dropped from the balloon with a time fuse over the besieged city.
                However, these balloons do not meet the current definition of drones, which according to The Oxford English Dictionary is “a remote-less
                controlled piloted aircraft or missile”. <br/><br/>

                <strong> 1910 - 1915</strong> <br/><br/>

                Going by the definition (Unmanned aerial vehicle), the first pilotless aircraft were developed after World War I in 1916.
                 Shortly after, the U.S. Army built the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettering_Bug">Kettering Bug</a> , intended to be used as “aerial torpedoes” using gyroscopic controls.
                  The first Kettering Bug flew in 1918, but the war ended before it could be used.<br/><br/>
                 

                <strong> 1930 - 1945</strong> <br/><br/>

                The first large-scale production, purpose-built drone was the product of Reginald Denny. He served with the British Royal Flying Corps during
                World War I, and after the war, in 1919, emigrated to the United States to seek his fortunes in Hollywood as an actor. Denny had made a name
                for himself as an actor, and between acting jobs, he pursued his interest in radio control model aircraft in the 1930s. He and his business
                partners formed "Reginald Denny Industries" and opened a model plane shop in 1934 on Hollywood Boulevard known as "Reginald Denny Hobby Shops".<br/><br/>

                The shop evolved into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioplane_Company">"Radioplane Company"</a>. Denny believed that low-cost RC aircraft would be very useful for training anti-aircraft gunners,
                and in 1935 he demonstrated a prototype target drone, the RP-1, to the US Army. Denny then bought a design from Walter Righter in 1938 and began
                marketing it to hobbyists as the "Dennymite", and demonstrated it to the Army as the RP-2, and after modifications as the RP-3 and RP-4 in 1939.
                In 1940, Denny and his partners won an Army contract for their radio controlled RP-4, which became the Radioplane OQ-2. They manufactured nearly
                fifteen thousand drones for the Army during World War II.<br/><br/>
                
                The true inventor of a radio-controlled aircraft that could fly out of sight was Edward M. Sorensen as evidenced by his US patents. His invention
                was the first to be able to know from a ground terminal, what the airplane was doing, such as climbing, altitude, banking, direction, rpm and
                other instrumentation. Without these patents the early radio-controlled aircraft could only operate within visual sight of the ground pilot.<br/><br/>

                <strong> 1975 - 1995</strong> <br/><br/>

                Even though the U.S. was able to achieve a breakthrough in mass-manufacturing and supplying drones for the military, UAVs were often considered 
                unreliable and expensive. This perspective however changed in 1982 when Israel forces used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mole_Cricket_19">unmanned aircrafts to gain victory over Syrian Air</a>
                Force with minimal losses. The U.S. also began the Pioneer UAV Program in 1980 to build an inexpensive drone for fleet operations. A joint 
                project by U.S. and Israel in 1986 further led to the development of RQ2 Pioneer – a medium sized reconnaissance aircraft.<br/><br/>

                <strong> 1995 - 2010</strong> <br/><br/>

                Mini and micro versions of the UAVs were introduced in 1990, and the famous Predator was introduced in 2000, which was used in Afghanistan
                for the search of Osama Bin Laden. In the following years, the number of small-sized, fixed-wing surveillance drones such as <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/RQ-11_Raven">Raven</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroVironment_Wasp_III"> Wasp</a>,
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroVironment_RQ-20_Puma">Puma</a> were introduced by an American technology company AeroVironment Inc. Raven is currently used by many countries, with around 20,000
                units already deployed.<br/><br/>
