                <p>From the beginning of the realization of this project, we decided to divided up the tasks that we had to do.<br/><br/>
                    Indeed, the fact that this website is composed of several pages allowed us to divide the work while remaining linked.<br/><br/>
                    Each of us think that this project was very interisting due to the fact that we learnt a lot of things about the creation
                    of a website !<br/><br/>
                    We are a team of 3 students. Here, discover our feedbacks and which part was realized by who:

            <li class="Presentation_Florian">"For this project, I have been working on the footer. I was surprised how important this was for the user.
                It gives us information that are very important.<br/><br/>Futhermore I created the page "Drone's history" and "Our future Drone".<br/>
                It was very fun working as a group in a project like this.<br/><br/>We learnt fundamental knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript and I hope
                we will have other projects like that in the future."</li>
            <li class="Presentation_Timothy">"I had no clue about what this webpage was going to cover until our friend Elerig suggested the idea of drones.
                I was immediatly seduced as I knew little on the subject and wanted to enrich my knowledge on the latter.<br/><br/>
                After the distribution of tasks, I decided to handle the "issues" and "domains of application" linked to drones pages and did a pretty good job
                in finding the right information before organising it into different sections.<br/><br/>This project enabled me to learn a lot about drones as well as
                developing my javascript skills which weren't that deep before the creation of this website. I will say teamwork was crucial and helped us get
                where we wanted, as well as developing another set of human skills.<br/><br/>
                Several problems persisted for a little longer than others, like the page layout, the phone version and some javascript effects. With the combined
                work of the 3 of us, we managed to minimize those issues to make the best out of this project."</li>
            
            <li class="Presentation_Elerig">"During the creation of this website, I was able to create the Home page, as well as the Quiz part but also
                the page which you are reading actually !<br/><br/> Being able to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript was something that I found very interesting !<br/>
                Making the Home page with effects using Javascript was pretty fun ! Interacting with the user in doing the QUIZ was something new to me, and very nice !<br/><br/>
                Even if we decided to divide the realization of this website into different parts, I still could help my collegues for the realization of their own pages.<br/><br/>
                Finally, this IT project was not always easy to build but it was really interesting and I consider that we made a good job !"
